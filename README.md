# MyInspectors

A [BepisLoader](https://github.com/ResoniteModding/BepisLoader) mod for [Resonite](https://resonite.com/) that makes it so when you open a slot in an inspector panel, you will generate the content instead of the host.

1. Install [BepisLoader](https://github.com/ResoniteModding/BepisLoader) for Resonite.
2. Download the latest release ZIP file (e.g., `art0007i-MyInspectors-2.1.1.zip`) from the [Releases](https://github.com/art0007i/MyInspectors/releases) page.
3. Extract the ZIP and copy the `plugins` folder to your BepInEx folder in your Resonite installation directory:
   - **Default location:** `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Resonite\BepInEx\`
4. Start the game. If you want to verify that the mod is working you can check your BepInEx logs.
